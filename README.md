# SpeechEmotion-LSTM
A web-based application that analyzes audio recordings to automatically detect the speakerâ€™s emotional state. It extracts MFCC features from speech and uses an LSTM network to classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, or neutral. The app provides interactive feedback, showing processing progress and final predictions in real time.
